# Kiwi Engine

Kiwi Engine is a TypeScript-based 2D web game engine.

## Features

### Coordinate System

Unlike most other 2D engines that use the top-left corner of the screen as `0, 0`, Kiwi Engine sets `0, 0` at the center of the screen. This is due to the nature of the web, where browser screens are often dynamic. By placing `0, 0` at the center, it becomes easier to organize objects and UI elements.

### Canvas Size

The size of the canvas is set to match the size of its parent element. If the parent elementâ€™s size changes, the canvas size changes accordingly. When the parent element is `body` and `body` matches the size of the window, the canvas will also match the window size, and it will resize automatically when the window size changes.
